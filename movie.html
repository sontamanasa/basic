  <h4 style="margin-left: 350px;">WHAT I LIKE MOST:</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 500px;">The Male lead (Fang leng) is the best in whatever he does. The Aww kinda part in the drama is he falls for the girl again and again though he has amnesia. But he expresses it in a very genuine way and he never compromises on her for others. He always stands by her no matter what. A CEO with so much of passion towards his company is adorable. And the female lead(Xioqui) is characterised in such a way that she is always ready to help everyone. She always roams around with a zeal and spreads positivity around her. She is even ready to not return to her planet just to save Fang Leng.</p>
  <h4 style="margin-left: 350px;">WHAT I DISLIKE MOST:</h4>
  <p style="margin-left: 500px;">I think there is nothing to dislike about that series.</p>
